The Rule-of-thumb of ill-conditioning says that if cond(A) = 10 t , and the entries of A and
b are correct to s decimal places, then one should expect an agreement of at least s âˆ’ t
significant digits in the corresponding entries of the exact solution and computed solution
of Ax = b obtained from GEPP or from Cholesky decomposition (which is applied if A is
positive definite).
Given a Hilbert matrix H, the aim of the code is to verify the above rule of thumb for
solutions of the system Hx = b obtained via a number of different solution methods.
